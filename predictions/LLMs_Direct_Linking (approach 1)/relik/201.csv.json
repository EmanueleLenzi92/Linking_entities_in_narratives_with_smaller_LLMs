In Macedonia there were also big oscillations in tobacco production, depending on the state policy. In fact, this production was going to collapse, but with the subsiding policy of the state it has been reestablished, with good opportunities even to increase. This is especially important because there is no alternative crop that would absorb so much labor force and would have such an economic impact as tobacco. Annually about 30,000 families or approximately 100,000 people are involved in tobacco production. Tobacco is important for the Macedonian agriculture, because it uses relatively poorer soils, for which no one-year culture could contribute so much.",
