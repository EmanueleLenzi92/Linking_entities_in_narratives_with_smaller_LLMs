Deer hunting (stalking) are popular tourist activities within the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. The land is which the stalking takes place is wild land, however it is managed in terms of the culling of mountain hares and burning of heather/ gorse to improve hunting potential in the area. Stalking season for stags runs between July and October, but roe and fallow bucks can be stalked almost year round. Within Perth and Kinross (LAU1) there are a range of estates and gamekeepers offering opportunities for stalking including Blair Atholl Estates and Glen Lyon. Venison meat is then sold across Perth and Kinross and the wider Highlands and islands NUT3 region in local butchers and online hubs e.g. www.highlandgame.com.",
