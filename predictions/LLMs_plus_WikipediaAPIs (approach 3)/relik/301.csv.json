Pultost is a sour milk cheese made from cow's milk without the use of rennet. Instead, a self-produced culture of old strains of lactic bacteria is added to start the coagulation. Once the cheese is drained, crumbled and fermented, salt and caraway seeds are added to stop fermentation, giving to it a special character. The cheese can be eaten fresh or matured in wooden containers up to one year. The leftover cream is used to produce sour cream or butter. This cheese is endorsed by the Slowfood Foundation for Biodiversity.",
