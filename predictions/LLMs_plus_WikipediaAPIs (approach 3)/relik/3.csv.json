Moreover, from an ecological perspective, the cultivation of herbs helps improve the quality of near-natural areas by enabling more diverse agricultural production with less use of pesticides. Flowering plants in particular provide insects with nectar and pollen at different times of the year and thus have the potential to reduce habitat fragmentation. Preserving areas suitable for wild collection and carefully collecting herbs is a suitable way of preserving the diversity of permanent grasslands without changing the type of land use. On the one hand, this represents an increased food supply for insects and, on the other hand, it offers additional income for the local farmers. ",
