The adaptability and ease in farming led to the cultivation of Aloe vera as an alternative plant during economic crisis of 2008-2016. The plant is being processed to produce juice, gel, cosmetics, and nutraceuticals involving research, new processing and production methods and marketing strategies. The juice has been successfully integrated in the local diet and the cosmetics are also being marketed in the tourist sector. The main problem for producers is the distribution of the leaves and the fact that only a small number of leaf-processing units exist. Another issue is the seasonality in production that does not cover the fixed seasonal demand of the industry. The high cost of quality certification is also a detriment. The cooperation of Minoan Land has participated in many festivals, such as that of Cretan Diet Festival, while the Pancretan Network of Organic Farmers of Aloe Vera has cooperated with Minoan Land.",

In the past 10 years a specific variety is being cultivated and exported. Aloe vera is drought tolerant and ideal for growing in dry conditions such as those in the Dikti mountain landscape and elsewhere in the semi-mountainous regions of Crete. It is grown in the Dikti area and processed in newly established processing and marketing companies in the same region. There is a high interest in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical products leading to innovation in processing and production opening wider export pathways. Aloe vera has had an essential role as a medicinal plant over millennia in the region. Its recent cultivation has continued this tradition in the Dikti mountian area, Crete, Greece, and other European countries. Aloe Vera's adaptation to the climatic and bioclimatic conditons of Viannos has been excellent. Non-demanding cultivation and use of organic fertilization has been applied. There has been a keen interest in growing aloe plants at both amateur and professional level. Strong interest of consumers in North America and Europe to use natural byproducts for health care. Recent development of processing facilities and market pathways. The cooperative of Minoan Land cooperates mostly with producers from Viannos, but in general it is a PanCretan Network. Hence, it is a value chain that has a dramatic impact both on a local and on a broader level.",
