The production of honey in the mountainous is usual a complementary activity of local people while few beekeeprs have been focused on the more intensive form of production. Obviously, locals have a strong historical, cultural and social tie with beekeeping (Minoan Civilization 1600 BC). This tradition is a source of inspiration and creation in many other fields such as literature. poetry, jewellery production etc.). Due to the special climate of Crete (high number of sunshine days annually, not extremely low temperatures, etc.) these activities take place for a long time in the mountainous areas, significantly helping the local communities. During the autumn the bee colonies are transferred to specific forest areas where bees are able to collect the pine tree juices in order to produce pine honey. These seasonal activities can reduce the outflow of the local population to urban centres. ",
