The cheese is made from April to October and has always been made with milk from the local goats. There are three families belonging to the Undredal St\u00f8lsysteri SA. Although they do not pasteurize the milk, they have full authorization for production and sale throughout Europe. Since 2005, the Slowfood Foundation for Biodiversity established here the first Norwegian Presidium for the Brimost cheese. The Presidium (Undredal Brown Cheese Presidium) includes 6 cheese makers of the cooperative plus two shopkeepers of the town that sell the local cheese. They sell the cheese online, in the Undredal's local store, in the annual cheese market in Undredal and in other regions' markets. The VC has great influence in the SES, since the activity is of great importance for the maintenance of natural pastures while the end product is a key asset for the village, attracting many visitors and energising the local enconomy.",
