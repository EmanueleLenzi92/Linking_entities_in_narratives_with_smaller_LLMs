Drivers for innovations have always been members of the initiative and the network it is embedded in: due to its embeddedness into the broader regional development initiatives, ALMO key persons work together with others in local action groups, which have been set up within LEADER for different projects. This leads to a cross-sectoral exchange of ideas and insights into various fields of broader regional development concept. Most innovations resulted from different actors bringing in different knowledge and different expertise. E.g. specific feeding practices (in order to achieve a very high meat quality) have been developed by the farmers in cooperation with one of the business partners, and a consultant (innovation based practice and academic knowledge). Another example is the building of stables: one of the farmers, who had to build a new free-range stable, had seen such stables somewhere else, and developed an adaptation of this type for the Almenland region. Many of the other farmers rebuilt their stables according to his model ( System Haberl ). The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies.
